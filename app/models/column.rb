  # Methods

  # Get the name of the column. This function would not be necessary if the column name attribute
  # was changed to just be name; the only reason for this function is that
  # calling the attribute 'column name' made it easier to differentiate in the
  # design phase of development, but 'name' is practically better.
  #
  # @return [String] The name of the column.

  # or manually by admin.

  # @return [Boolean] True iff the request to CollegiateLink was successful.
