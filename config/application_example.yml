# For new projects, copy this to a new file named
# Put app configuration vars into application.yml
# We load these settings in via the Figaro gem
#
# To access these constants (anywhere in the app), just do ENV['constant']
# where 'constant' is the name of the constant in here
#
# IMPORTANT
# Git ignore the application.yml file and NEVER commit it
# If you do accidentally commit it, you must change all the secrets stored
# here, as even if later removed it will still be viewable in Git history.
