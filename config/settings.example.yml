# In the settings.yml file we can add constants that we don't want the public to see
#
# We load these files in application.rb via:
# ENV.update YAML.load_file('config/settings.yml')[Rails.env] rescue {}
#
# To access these constants (anywhere in the app), just do ENV['constant']
# where 'constant' is the name of the constant in here
#
# IMPORTANT
# It's super important that you gitignore settings.yml and NEVER commit it to the repo.
# If you do you will need to change all the secrets stored here,
# as even if later removed it'll still be viewable in the git history
